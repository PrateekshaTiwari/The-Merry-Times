# The-Merry-Times
A positive news website for children to avoid the negative effects of news related to suicides, deaths, pandemic, etc.
The user interface is simple and colourful making it easy for the child to use the website. 
The website has a publisher login and signup page. On successful login of the publisher there is also a compose page where the publisher can publish his/her news articles.
Every news article has a listen feature which reads the news in case the child is not willing to read by himself/herself.
Some screenshots of the website are:
